# System Configuration
This is the main system configuration for all of my machines! I use:
- nixos
- i3wm (when on x11)
- hyprland (when on wayland)
- neovim

The core flake.nix has many different configurations. I started a trend of naming machines after anime girls when I was 14, and have continued that tradition.
kotoko - main desktop
horikita - laptop
megumin - homelab
rpi - raspberry pi
