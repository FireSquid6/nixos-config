# System Configuration
This is the main system configuration for all of my machines! I use:
- nixos
- i3wm (when on x11)
- hyprland (when on wayland)
- neovim

It's always a work in progress. Much of the scripts should be more declarative. 

This repo gets cloned to `/etc/nixos` on my new machines.
